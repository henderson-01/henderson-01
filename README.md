### 💻 My Setup & Background
- 🐧 **OS:** Recently transitioned from **Windows** to **Ubuntu Desktop** (loving the Linux workflow!).

- ⚙️ **Git:** Learning version control locally and syncing my progress here.

### 📝 Documentation & Cheat Sheets
I love making **Markdown cheat sheets**! I find that breaking down difficult concepts into simple, scannable help guides is the best way to learn. 
*Expect to see various "cheat sheet" repositories here as I find new ways to simplify coding.*
