# Hi there, I'm Mr Henderson! 👋

### 🚀 Student Developer | Focused on Python & Automation
I am a self-directed learner, building projects and documenting my learning journey as I go.

### 💻 My Setup & Background
- 🐧 **OS:** Recently transitioned from **Windows** to **Ubuntu pro LTS Desktop** (loving the Linux workflow!).
- 🐍 **Language:** Currently mastering **Python** and computer programming fundamentals.
- ⚙️ **Git:** Learning version control locally and syncing my progress here.

### 📝 Documentation & Cheat Sheets
I love making **Markdown cheat sheets & Help Guides**! I find that breaking down difficult concepts into simple, scannable help guides is the best way to learn. 
*Expect to see various "cheat sheet" repositories here as I find new ways to simplify coding and applications.*
